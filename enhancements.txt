Top enhancements (short list)

Integrate a full JSON Schema validator (recommended next step)

What: Use a library such as nlohmann/json-schema-validator (https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator) and convert YAML to JSON before validating. This supports full draft support, $ref, formats, and comprehensive schema features.
Why: The current validator only does basic checks. Using a validated library gives correct, standards-compliant validation.
Effort: Medium (1–2 days). Need to add dependency + CMake changes, convert YAML node to nlohmann::json reliably, update tests/examples.
Files to change: CMakeLists.txt, yaml_parser.hpp, yaml_parser.cpp, main.cpp, tests.
Add unit tests and CI

What: Add Catch2 or GoogleTest + tests for load/validate/print and failure cases. Add GitHub Actions workflow to build + run tests.
Why: Ensures correctness and prevents regressions.
Effort: Small–Medium (half to 1 day for basic tests + CI template).
Files to add: test/CMakeLists.txt, test/*.cpp, .github/workflows/ci.yml.
Improve CLI UX (flags & output formats)

What: Add flags --json-output (print config as JSON), --verbose, --exit-code behavior, --set key=value overrides to modify loaded config.
Why: More useful as a CLI tool and friendly for scripting.
Effort: Small (hours).
Files to change: main.cpp.
Packaging and dependency management

What: Add vcpkg or Conan support; add install targets in CMake; provide pkg-config or CMake config export.
Why: Easier integration into other projects.
Effort: Medium.
Logging, diagnostics, and sanitizers

What: Add spdlog, richer errors with YAML line numbers, enable ASAN/UBSAN in CI.
Why: Improves developer experience and robustness.
Effort: Small–Medium.
Documentation and examples

What: Expand README, add more examples, and a CONTRIBUTING guide.
Why: Helps users adopt the library.
Effort: Small.
Security/fuzz testing

What: Add fuzz targets and run sanitizers.
Why: Safety and hardening.
Effort: Medium–Large.
Concrete next step (my recommended first implementation)

Integrate nlohmann/json-schema-validator and convert YAML -> JSON before calling the library. This gives full, standards-compliant validation and is the most valuable improvement.
If you want, I can implement that now. I would:

Add dependency in CMakeLists.txt (FetchContent or system package).
Add a helper to convert YAML::Node to nlohmann::json in yaml_parser.cpp.
Replace current validate logic with a call to the json-schema-validator.
Add a basic unit test and update README examples.
